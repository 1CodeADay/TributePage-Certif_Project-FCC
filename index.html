        Here's a time line of the history of computers:
      </h3>

      <ul>
                <li><strong>3000 B.C.</strong> - The Abacus: The first known mechanical calculator invented in Babylon.</li>
        <li><strong>1642</strong> - The Pascaline: Blaise Pascal invents the first mechanical calculator, which can perform addition and subtraction.</li>
        <li><strong>1837</strong> - The Analytical Engine: Charles Babbage designs a mechanical computer that can be programmed with punch cards.</li>
        <li><strong>1936</strong> - The Turing Machine: Alan Turing describes a theoretical machine that can solve any problem that a human can, known as the Turing machine.</li>
        <li><strong>1943</strong> - The ENIAC: The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) is the first general-purpose electronic digital computer.</li>
        <li><strong>1947</strong> - The Transistor: The transistor is invented at Bell Labs, paving the way for smaller, faster computers.</li>
        <li><strong>1951</strong> - The UNIVAC: The UNIVAC I is the first commercial computer produced in the United States.</li>
        <li><strong>1971</strong> - The Microprocessor: The Intel 4004 is the first microprocessor, which combines the CPU, memory, and input/output functions on a single chip.</li>
        <li><strong>1981</strong> - The IBM PC: IBM introduces the IBM PC, which becomes the standard for personal computers.</li>
        <li><strong>1991</strong> - The World Wide Web: Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web, making the internet accessible to everyone.</li>
        <li><strong>2007</strong> - The iPhone: Apple introduces the iPhone, revolutionizing the smartphone industry.</li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong> - The Quantum Computer: Google announces the development of a quantum computer that can perform calculations much faster than traditional computers.</li>
      </ul>
